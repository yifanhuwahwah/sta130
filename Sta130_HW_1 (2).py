# # Based on chatgpt's answer, here are my general definition of the term 'observations' and 'variables' in context of my dataset
# 
# # Observation definition:
# # In a dataset, an observation refers to a single data entry orrecord that represents a unit of analysis
# # This means that each observation represent a row of the dataset
# # In the context of this Pokémon dataset，each observation represents a specific Pokémon
# # Each row of the dataset, or observation corresponds to one Pokémon, capturing all the details about that Pokémon such as its name, type and stats.
# 
# # Variables definition
# # A variable represents a specific attribute or characteristic measured for each observation.
# # In a dataset, variables are the columns that hold different types of information about each observation.
# # In the context of this Pokémon dataset, variables or columns include attributes like "Name"(the name of the Pokémon), "Type" (the type of the Pokémon) and "HP" (Hit Points),

# 
# #df.describe() Output:
# 
# #df.describe() by default provides summary statistics only for numeric columns.
# #The "count" in df.describe() represents the number of non-missing values in each numeric column. Thus, if a numeric column has missing values (NaNs), its "count" will be less than the total number of rows shown by df.shape.
# 
# #The Discrpancies：
# 
# #Columns Analyzed: 
# #df.describe() only analyzes numeric columns by default. Non-numeric columns (e.g., "Name," "Sex," "Embarked") are not included unless you specify df.describe(include='all') or df.describe(include=['O']).
# 
# #Values Reported in the "Count" Column: 
# #The "count" in df.describe() shows the number of non-missing values for each numeric column. If there are missing values, this count will be less than the total number of rows reported by df.shape.

# #chatbot response：
# 
# # Attribute (e.g.:df.shape):
# 
# # An attribute in Python is a property of an object that stores some value or information about that object.
# # Attributes do not require parentheses () when accessed because they are not "called" like functions; they are simply accessed.
# # For example, df.shape is an attribute of a pandas DataFrame df that gives the size of the DataFrame in terms of rows and columns (e.g., (891, 15) for the Titanic dataset).
# 
# # Method (e.f. df.describe()):
# 
# # A method is a function that is associated with an object and performs some action or computation.
# # Methods require parentheses () because they are "called" to execute some code.
# # For example, df.describe() is a method that computes and returns summary statistics for numerical columns in the DataFrame df.
# 
# #My own summary of the difference between attributes and methods
# 
# #Attributes:
# 
# #Attributes are properties of an object. 
# #They store information about the object without performing any action or computation. 
# #Accessing an attribute is simular to looking up information that is already stored. 
# #For example, df.shape tells you the number of rows and columns in a DataFrame without doing any calculations. 
# #it’s just a piece of information stored in the object.
# 
# #Methods:
# 
# #Methods are actions that an object can perform. 
# 
# #They are similar to functions in programming, where you provide some input , and they return an output after executing instructions. 
# #Methods are called with parentheses (), and sometimes with arguments, to perform some operation. 
# #For example, df.describe() computes and returns statistics like min and max for numeric columns in the DataFrame.
# #Calling a method is simular to asking the object to give you computed information.
# 
# 

# ##Chatbot session summary to this point:
# 
# #1. Loading and Analyzing Datasets:
# 
# # We used various datasets to explore how to load and analyze data using pandas in Python.
# # Code Example:
# 
# import pandas as pd
# 
# url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KeithGalli/pandas/master/pokemon_data.csv"
# df = pd.read_csv(url)
# 
# rows, columns = df.shape
# print(f"The dataset has {rows} rows and {columns} columns.")
# 
# #2. Providing Simple Summaries:
# 
# # We discussed how to provide simple summaries of datasets:
# 
# # Descriptive Statistics: df.describe() gives statistical summaries for numeric columns.
# # Value Counts: df['column'].value_counts() shows counts of unique values in categorical columns
# 
# # Code Example: 
# 
# print("Descriptive statistics for numerical columns:")
# print(df.describe())
# 
# print("\nValue counts for 'Type 1' column (categorical variable):")
# print(df['Type 1'].value_counts())
# 
# #3. Understanding Discrepancies:
# 
# # df.shape provides the total number of rows and columns in the dataset.
# 
# # df.describe() provides statistics only for numeric columns and shows the count of non-missing values, which may be less than the total number of rows due to missing data.
# 
# # Code example with Titanic dataset:
# 
# url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/titanic.csv"
# df = pd.read_csv(url)
# 
# print("Shape of the dataset (rows, columns):")
# print(df.shape)
# 
# print("\nDescriptive statistics for numerical columns:")
# print(df.describe())
# 
# print("\nMissing values in each column:")
# print(df.isna().sum())
# 
# #4. Attributes vs. Methods:
# 
# # Attributes: Properties of an object that store data or information. Accessed without parentheses (e.g., df.shape).
# 
# # Methods: Functions associated with an object that perform actions or computations. Called with parentheses (e.g., df.describe()).
# 
# # Summary:
# 
# # Attributes provide direct information about an object (no () needed).
# # Methods perform operations or calculations on an object (require () to be called).
# 
# # This session covered loading datasets, summarizing data, understanding discrepancies between dataset size metrics, 
# # and differentiating between attributes and methods in Python.

# ##6. 
# # Count: 
# # The number of non-null entries in each column. 
# # Count represents the total number of observations for that variable, excluding any missing or NaN values.
# 
# # Mean: 
# # The average value of the observations in a column. 
# # Mean calculated by summing all the values and dividing by the count of the values.
# 
# # Std (Standard Deviation):
# # A measure of the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values. 
# # A high standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range, while a low standard deviation indicates that the values are closer to the mean.
# 
# # Min: 
# # The smallest value in the column. 
# # Minimum represents the lower boundary of the data range.
# 
# # 25% (1st Quartile or Q1): 
# # The value below which 25% of the observations fall. It's the first quartile in the data distribution.
# 
# # 50% (Median or 2nd Quartile): 
# # The middle value of the observations when they are sorted in ascending order. 
# # It divides the data into two equal halves.
# 
# # 75% (3rd Quartile or Q3): 
# # The value below which 75% of the observations fall. 
# # It's the third quartile in the data distribution.
# 
# # Max: 
# # The largest value in the column. 
# # Maximum represents the upper boundary of the data range.

# # difference between df.dropna() and del df['col']:
# 
# #df.dropna(): Removes rows (or columns) with missing values (NaN). It is useful when you want to remove incomplete records from your dataset.
# 
# #del df['col']: Deletes a specific column from the DataFrame entirely. It is useful when you no longer need a specific column.
# 
# # example of a "use case" in which using df.dropna() might be peferred over using del df['col']:
# 
# #Imagine you are working with a dataset of employee records for a company, which includes information such as EmployeeID, Name, Age, Department, and Salary. 
# #Some rows have missing values for the Age or Salary columns. To perform statistical analysis or machine learning tasks, you want to remove rows where Age or Salary is missing.
# #In this scenario, using df.dropna() is more appropriate because you want to keep all the relevant columns but onlyremove the rows with missing values.
# 
# #example of code using df.dropna():
# 
# import pandas as pd
# 
# # Sample DataFrame
# data = {
#     'EmployeeID': [101, 102, 103, 104, 105],
#     'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David', 'Eve'],
#     'Age': [25, None, 30, 22, None],
#     'Department': ['HR', 'Finance', 'IT', 'IT', 'Marketing'],
#     'Salary': [50000, 60000, None, 55000, 52000]
# }
# 
# df = pd.DataFrame(data)
# 
# # Using df.dropna() to remove rows with missing values
# df_cleaned = df.dropna()
# 
# print(df_cleaned)
# 
# #why using df.dropa() is better here:
# 
# #df.dropna() is the better choice when you want to keep all columns intact but remove rows with missing values to ensure clean and complete data for analysis.
# #On the other hand, del df['col'] would be inappropriate in this scenario because it removes an entire column, losing valuable data.
# 
# 
# 

# ##7.
# #2.
# 
# #example of "the opposite use case" in which using del df['col'] might be preferred over using df.dropna():
# 
# # Imagine you are working with a dataset containing information about customer transactions, 
# # with columns like TransactionID, CustomerName, CustomerID, Product, Quantity, and Comments. 
# # The Comments column contains some free-text notes about the transactions,
# # but this column is not useful for the analysis you want to perform, 
# # such as summarizing total quantities sold or calculating the average purchase amount.
# # Additionally, the Comments column has a lot of missing values.
# # In this scenario, using del df['Comments'] is more appropriate because the column itself is unnecessary for your analysis, 
# #and dropping rows with missing values in the Comments column using df.dropna() would result in losing valuable data in other columns.
# 
# #example of code using del df['col']:
# 
# import pandas as pd
# 
# # Sample DataFrame
# data = {
#     'TransactionID': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
#     'CustomerName': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David', 'Eve'],
#     'CustomerID': [101, 102, 103, 104, 105],
#     'Product': ['Widget A', 'Widget B', 'Widget A', 'Widget C', 'Widget B'],
#     'Quantity': [5, 2, 3, 7, 1],
#     'Comments': [None, 'Urgent', None, 'Delivered on time', None]
# }
# 
# df = pd.DataFrame(data)
# 
# # Using del df['Comments'] to remove the unnecessary column
# del df['Comments']
# 
# print(df)
# 
# #why using del df['col'] is better here:
# 
# #del df['col'] is the better choice when you want to remove an entire column that is irrelevant or unnecessary for your analysis. 
# #In contrast, using df.dropna() in this scenario would result in the unwanted loss of rows that are otherwise complete and valuable for analysis.
# 
# 
# 

# ##7
# #3 
# # Here are reasons why u should applying del df['col'] before df.dropna() when both are used together could be important:
# 
# # Prevent Unnecessary Row Deletion: df.dropna() removes rows with missing values in any column. 
# # If an unnecessary column (col) has many missing values, using df.dropna() first would remove valuable rows. 
# # By deleting col first using del df['col'] , you prevent this.
# 
# # Efficiency: Deleting unnecessary columns reduces the DataFrame size with del df['col'], 
# # making subsequent operations like df.dropna() faster and more memory-efficient.
# 

# ##7.
# #4.
# 
# # Example Dataset:
# 
# #I will use the following dataset of customer orders:
# 
# import pandas as pd
# 
# # Sample DataFrame
# data = {
#     'OrderID': [101, 102, 103, 104, 105],
#     'CustomerName': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David', 'Eve'],
#     'Product': ['Widget A', 'Widget B', 'Widget A', 'Widget C', 'Widget B'],
#     'Quantity': [5, 2, None, 7, None],
#     'Remarks': [None, 'Urgent', None, 'Delivered on time', None]
# }
# 
# df = pd.DataFrame(data)
# 
# # Before Cleanup using 
# 
# # print DataFrame before any cleanup:
# 
# print("Before Cleanup:")
# print(df)
# 
# # Delete irrelevant 'Remarks' column
# del df['Remarks']
# 
# #Drop rows with missing values in remaining columns
# df_cleaned = df.dropna()
# 
# print("After Cleanup:")
# print(df_cleaned)
# 
# 
# 
# # Justification for Approach:
# 
# # Removing Irrelevant Columns:
#    #The `Remarks` column had many missing values and was irrelevant to the analysis.
#    #Removing it first ensures that `df.dropna()` does not remove rows with missing values in this column, which could lead to losing valuable data.
# 
# # Focusing on Relevant Data:
#    #After removing the irrelevant column, `df.dropna()` is used to clean the remaining dataset by removing rows with missing values in the relevant columns (`OrderID`, `CustomerName`, `Product`, `Quantity`). 
#    #This approach ensures that we keep only the complete rows that are essential for our analysis.
# 
# # Efficiency:
#    #Deleting the unnecessary column reduces the DataFrame size and simplifies the cleanup process, making `df.dropna()` more efficient and focused on the relevant data.

# import pandas as pd
# 
# # Load Titanic dataset
# url = 'https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs109/cs109.1166/stuff/titanic.csv'
# titanic_df = pd.read_csv(url)

# 
# #Applying df.groupby("col1")["col2"].describe()
# 
# # Group by 'Pclass' and describe 'Age'
# age_description_by_class = titanic_df.groupby("Pclass")["Age"].describe()
# 
# print(age_description_by_class)
# 
# # Using df.groupby("col1")["col2"].describe() helps to summarize how a particular column (col2, e.g., Age) varies across different groups (col1, e.g., Pclass).
# # This can reveal patterns and insights related to age distributions within different passenger classes on the Titanic, which might be useful for further analysis or understanding of the dataset.

# #Example:
# #Using the Titanic dataset:
# 
# # df.describe() provides overall statistics for columns like Age and Fare.
# 
# # df.groupby("Pclass")["Age"].describe() provides more detailed statistics on Age within each Pclass, showing group-specific counts and distributions.
# 
# #key difference:
# 
# #The Scope:
# 
# # df.describe(): Considers the entire dataset.
# 
# # df.groupby("col1")["col2"].describe(): Considers each group separately.
# 
# #Impact of Missing Values:
# 
# # df.describe(): Gives a general view of missing data across the dataset.
# # df.groupby("col1")["col2"].describe(): Shows how missing values vary across different groups.

# #A:
#  # For this error, chatbot generate an correct example of without the 'NameError' and tell me to include 'import pandas as pd'.
#  # Google search just tell me to include 'import pandas as pd',.
#  # For me, google search is more straightforward in this scenario.
#     
# #B:
#  # For this error, chatbot generate a list of reasons why the error happens.
#  # Google search just give me the correct url to the titanic dataset.
#  # I prefer google search in this case since for this type of error, all I need is a correct url link for the dataset.
#     
# #C
#  # For this error, the chatbot quickly identifies it as a NameError and generates the correct version of the code for me.
#  # Google search failed to identify the error immediately; I had to scroll through a couple of pages to find out why this error occurred.
#  # In this case, chatbot is clearly a superior option.
#     
# #D
#  # The chatbot failed to identify that I forgot to include a closing parenthesis in my code 'pd.read_csv(url'. Instead, it simply generated an explanation of the code.
#  # Although it was a bit time-consuming, I successfully found the error in my code pd.read_csv(url after scrolling through a few pages.
#  # Since Google search helped me find my error while the chatbot did not, Google search is the better option in this scenario.
#     
# #E
#  # The chatbot quickly identified my mistake and generated the correct code without any typos.
#  # With Google search, I had a really hard time figuring out what and where my typo was.

#     
# #F
#  # In this case, both Chatbot and Google Search helps me find and correct the error. 
#  # However, chatbot does the job quicker. Thus it is a better option here.
#  
#     
# #G
#  # The chatbot identifies the NameError in this case and generates the correct version for both lines of code.
#  # I had a hard time fixing the error with Google search, as it failed to identify the issue and provide me the correct version of the code.

# ## Chatbot session summary for the second half of the homework:
# 
# # Summary of the Session:
# 
# #1. Using df.dropna() vs. del df['col']:
# 
# # We discussed the difference between using df.dropna() to remove rows with missing values and del df['col'] to delete an entire column.
# # Use Case for df.dropna(): Preferred when you want to remove only rows with missing data without affecting the entire DataFrame structure.
# # Use Case for del df['col']: Preferred when you want to delete an entire column from the DataFrame.
# 
# #2. Combining df.dropna() and del df['col']:
# 
# # We discussed why applying del df['col'] before df.dropna() might be important. The reason is that deleting an irrelevant or unneeded column first can prevent unnecessary data loss when subsequently dropping rows with missing values.
# 
# #3. Understanding df.groupby("col1")["col2"].describe():
# 
# # We explored what df.groupby("col1")["col2"].describe() does. It groups the DataFrame by "col1" and provides descriptive statistics for "col2" within each group.
# # You were asked to demonstrate this with the Titanic dataset, using different examples than the ones typically provided.
# 
# #4. Differences Between df.describe() and df.groupby("col1")["col2"].describe():
# 
# # We discussed the fundamental difference between the count values in df.describe() (which reflects the total non-missing entries in each column) and df.groupby("col1")["col2"].describe() (which shows descriptive statistics for groups formed by "col1").
# 
# #5. NameError Handling in Code Examples:
# 
# # You introduced intentional errors in pandas code by using incorrect column names or missing quotes.
# # We identified these NameError cases (e.g., titanic_df.groupby(sex)["age"].describe() instead of titanic_df.groupby("sex")["age"].describe()), and I provided corrected versions along with error handling using try-except blocks.
# 
# # Simulation of Errors and Corrections:
#     
# # A detailed example was given to simulate these NameErrors and provide corrected code that demonstrates proper usage and handling of errors.
