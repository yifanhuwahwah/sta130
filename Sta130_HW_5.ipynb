In a two-tailed test, the code checks for simulated statistics that are \"as or more extreme\" in both directions (either greater than or less than the observed statistic), meaning it considers deviations on both sides of the null hypothesis value. In contrast, the one-tailed test only checks whether the simulated statistics are in one specific direction—either greater than or less than the observed statistic, depending on the hypothesis. This narrower focus leads to a different interpretation: the one-tailed test specifically assesses whether the observed effect is in the direction hypothesized (e.g., greater health improvement), rather than simply whether there is any difference. Since the one-tailed test restricts the \"extreme\" values to just one direction, the p-value in a one-tailed test is generally smaller than in a two-tailed test (assuming the observed statistic is in the expected direction), because fewer simulations are considered as \"extreme\" under the null hypothesis.\n",

    "This experiment is an adaptation of the famous Fisher’s Tea Experiment, in which statistician Ronald Fisher tested whether an individual could distinguish whether tea or milk was poured first into a cup. In this adaptation, students from STA130 participated in a similar experiment to determine if they can correctly identify which was poured first: tea or milk. Specifically, out of a random sample of 80 students, 49 students correctly identified which was poured first. This analysis aims to determine whether the students’ performance is due to chance or if they possess a real ability to distinguish between the two pour orders.\n",

In the STA130 version, students are similarly tasked with identifying the pour order, but the sample size is different, and the context is generalized for a classroom setting. While the core hypothesis remains similar—whether correct identifications are due to chance—the nature of the population and the test is more abstract in the classroom version.\n",

    "\n",
    "The Z-score, which measures how many standard deviations the observed result is from the null hypothesis, was found to be 2.01.

This p-value represents the probability of observing a result as extreme as ours, assuming that students are purely guessing.\n",

    "In this session, we discussed concepts related to hypothesis testing and statistical significance. You started by asking if a smaller p-value can definitively prove that the null hypothesis is false. I explained that a small p-value does not provide absolute proof; it only suggests strong evidence against the null hypothesis. We covered concepts like statistical significance, practical significance, Type I errors, and the limitations of p-values, emphasizing that statistical results are probabilistic, not definitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we moved on to a coding question about modifying a Python script to compute a p-value for a one-sided hypothesis test instead of a two-sided one. The original code calculated the p-value by checking if the simulated statistics were \"as or more extreme\" than the observed statistic in both directions, which is the approach for a two-tailed test. I explained the necessary code modifications to perform a one-tailed test, which involves checking only in the relevant direction (either greater than or less than) to match the one-sided hypothesis.\n",

    "I provided the adjusted code for a one-tailed test, along with an explanation of the logic behind it. Specifically, for a one-tailed test, we only look at whether simulated values are greater than (or less than) the observed value, depending on the hypothesis. This approach leads to a narrower range of \"extreme\" values, making the resulting p-value smaller compared to a two-tailed test, assuming the effect is in the hypothesized direction.\n",

    "Finally, we discussed how the change from a two-tailed to a one-tailed test alters the interpretation: the one-tailed test is more focused on whether the observed effect is in the hypothesized direction, rather than testing for any difference in either direction. We also noted that, because fewer simulations are considered \"extreme\" under the one-tailed test, the p-value is typically smaller in a one-tailed analysis compared to a two-tailed one, making it easier to achieve statistical significance if the observed effect matches the direction of the hypothesis."
